#Simple Web App

A flash sales application based on a [Sinatra Template](https://github.com/davidlumley/sinatra-template)

Uses:

*[Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css)
*[Concrete](https://github.com/davidlumley/concrete)
*[Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe.js)
*[jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
*[jQuery.payment](https://github.com/stripe/jquery.payment) - worth noting this is compatible with Zepto as well

It's fairly basic, but a good example of what you can do in a few hours to put together something that has all the elements you need to validate your product.
